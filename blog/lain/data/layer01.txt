Alice: Juri, don't mind it.

Reika: Yes. It must be someone's prank.

Juri: All... right...


Alice: Lain?

Alice: Did you receive it too?

Lain: What?

Alice: The mail.

Lain: Mail?

Alice: From Yomoda Chisa.

Lain: I'm not good with computers...

Alice: You should at least check your mail once a day.


Reika: Lain, you're still a child, aren't you?

Lain: Why is she crying?

Reika: Because, she received a mail from Yomoda Chisa.

Lain: Who's Chisa?

Reika: She was in class D. Last week, she killed herself by jumping off a building in Shibuya.

Reika: Our teacher also told us that.

Alice: It's not only Juri; many girls have received the mail this week.

Lain: But, she is...

Alice: Yes. Dead people can't send mails. But they really received it...

Navi: Lain, I went home from school with you once.

Navi: Do you remember it?

Lain: Yes.

Navi: I only abandoned my flesh. I can tell that I'm still alive.

Navi: Can you understand me?

Navi: It's alright if you don't. Soon you will understand. Others will, too.

Lain: Why did you die?

Navi: It seems that there is a rumor in school that this is a prank.

Navi: But I want you to know it's not.

Navi: God is here...

Lain: What?

Navi text: God...

Lain: I... I would like a new Navi.

Father: Hahaha, you finally got interested in this.

Father: Now, Lain is in junior high school. You'll fall behind your friends.

Father: You should use a better machine.

Father: Listen, Lain. In this world, every human is connected each other both in the wired and in the real world, and human societies are organized.

Father: Even someone like Lain can make friends quickly. No need to be afraid.

Father: I wonder why your mother doesn't understand it.

Lain: I'm not afraid.

Father: But, why do you get interested in this so suddenly?

Lain: I have a friend to meet.

Father: Hehehe...
